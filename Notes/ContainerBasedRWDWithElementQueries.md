## Container-based RWD with Element Queries #RWDElem

*The title of his talk is **actually** "Element-based RWD with Container Queries." It appears as if Sched has it wrong.*

Same HTML everywhere. CSS controls what (and how much) information to show

Not an accpeted standard. Has to be accomplished with a polyfill.
